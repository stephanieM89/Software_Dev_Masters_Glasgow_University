This assessed exercise involved creating a purchase/return application for a wine merchant

Application Specification
Lilybank Wine Merchants sells bottles of wine at a variety of prices on a sale or return basis.  Their customers are allowed to trade 
on credit (allowed to build up a debt to the wine merchant which can be settled later), and have a Customer Account record in which 
details of their balance owed to the wine merchants are stored.  The wine merchants want to automate their invoicing procedures.  
They require an interface that will allow a sales assistant to enter details of a series of sales and/or returns, and update the
customer balance as appropriate.
