**Programming Assessed Exercise 3 - Fitness Class Timetable**

The purpose of the assignment was to create a system which creates a fitness class timetable taking in an input file of classes.

Specification
The Boyd-Orr Sports Centre has decided that it wishes to encourage the participation of women in sport.  To implement this it has decided to designate Wednesday as Ladiesâ€™ Day and develop a sports programme designed to be attractive to women.  They propose to offer a series of scheduled tutored drop-in fitness classes.  Boyd-Orr Sports Centre is receiving a grant from the organisation Healthy West End to cover their costs, but Healthy West End will only continue this grant if they feel that there is adequate participation in the classes.  They insist that attendance is monitored every five weeks and, if the overall average attendance over the five weeks is below 12, unpopular classes must be cancelled and replaced with classes that, it is hoped, will be more popular.

An application is required to display the current class schedule and enable the monitoring and replacement to take place.
