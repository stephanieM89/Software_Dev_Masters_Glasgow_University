#TopTrumps

**Top Trumps Team Project 2017**

Description

This program implmements a version of Top Trumps.  It reads in a text file listing the categories and values for the individual cards.  A GUI allows the user to play against up to four computer players and provides all te relevant information to understand and follow the game-flow.  A range of message boxes guides the user in a self-explanatory fashion.  The program further connnects to a database in order to allow game results to be stored.  In addition, the user also has the option to write the information to a text file.

The report explains the user stories and sprint planning while also tracking the group's progress through the use of a Burn Down Chart.  All assumptions made regarding the game logic are introduced and a wide variety of test serves to demonstrate the game's functionality.
