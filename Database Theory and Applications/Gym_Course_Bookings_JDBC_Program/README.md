**Gym Course Bookings JDBC Program**

In this assessment, I was tasked with implementing a Java program which connects to the university gym database which I have been 
designing and implementing in the labs for this course. The aim is to write software which allows the user to add course bookings 
to and view course bookings from the database.

**The Task**

The purpose of this assignment is to build a Java program with a GUI which connects to the University Gym database and allow me to
view course booking information from the database anad add course bookings to the database.  In particular, I should be able to:

1. View all courses and the instructor taking them, the capacity of the course, and the number of members currently booked on the course.
2. View all members booked on a course i.e. member full name and ID and the name of the course for each course in your database.
3. Book a given member on a course.

Assume courses can take place Monday - Friday between 8am - 4pm and last one hour.  For the purpose of development, assume there is a 
maximum of 10 courses in the database and the maximum number of course bookings is 40.  Assume course names are unique.

Program should have a GUI which allows the user to see the courses running, the maximum capcity of those courses, and the current number 
of gym members booked on each course  It should allow the user to book a member from the database onto a course.  You should also be able 
to view the members booked on a course.
